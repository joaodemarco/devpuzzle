            <b>DevPuzzle</b> is a daily puzzle game made for developers. It's
            goal is to test your knowledge, sharpen your memory and make you

            Even though it's not a groundbreaking concept, I believe DevPuzzle
            offers fun and meaningful challenges. Feel free to suggest new game
            modes and improvements to the existing ones.

        <p>Have fun playing :)</p>
